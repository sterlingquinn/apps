This repository contains apps developed by Sterling Quinn, as well as their supporting libraries.

Currently there is one app available: Crowd Lens for OpenStreetMap. This is a geovisual analytics tool for understanding contribution patterns to OpenStreetMap. It is described in the article "A geovisual analytics exploration of the OpenStreetMap crowd" by Sterling Quinn and Alan MacEachren, forthcoming in 2017 in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science. 

This repository contains just a snapshot of the Crowd Lens tool, taken at the time the article was accepted for publication. The latest version of Crowd Lens is running at http://www.sterlingquinn.net/apps/crowdlens and may contain more recent data than what is seen here.
